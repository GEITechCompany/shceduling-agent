Hello Audrey,

I hope all is well.

I have discussed this situation with our team and we have decided to remedy this further by removing the charge for the downpipe clearing, as well as providing a 15% discount to the eaves trough cleaning cost. Additionally, we'd like to offer you a 10% discount on you next cleaning.

Please advise if you would like us to deduct these discounts from your next eaves/downspout cleaning or if you would like us to send you the difference now.

This appears to be hardwater, which is common on the bottom and corners of windows and usually requires a chemical clean, but for this time we will come and clean this free of charge.

And we'll make a note that there may hard water on your windows for us to keep an eye out for the next cleaning.

We have an opening for July 24th arriving between 11am-3pm.

Says there are 1 set of windows that are quite high up on the interior- extends out to the stair well may need a ladder on the inside. He said he may just do exterior now and interior later not sure yet. If doing interior the technicians can let themselves in and out. Maybe post C, new build says he doesn't see any post C though. Wants QUOTE for eaves troughs- probably won't clean them this time. He did not mention it but possible railing glass included.
Wants done as soon as possible.

LM FOR PICTURES. TRS FOR PICTURES. He called back, he is going to provide pictures over text of a unit that looks exactly like his, may have pictures of some parts of inside like the staircase.

Sent pictures doesn't provide much to say accurately how much it'll cost, but it's a new build so likely will be post construction....

Additional Information: Hello, we have a 2.5 storey home near Bloor and Lansdowne. Our exterior windows need cleaning, and our eavestroughs in the front need unclogging. There are five windows on the main floor, and six windows on the second storey. There is a seventh window on the second floor, but it's not really accessible from the outside, so we'll exclude this from the job. Just looking for a ballpark quote at this point. Thanks!

Clayton Chow (Homestars),"116 Orchard View Blvd, Toronto, M4R 1C2","BOOKING NOTES: 1. will send photos to resi email. The gutters along one side of our house are consistently overflowing and in the winter drip a lot of water down when ice is melting. We would like them repaired at least on one side of the house (approx 40 ft). 2. Optionally, we'd also like to re-route our downspout extension. It currently empties onto the driveway, and since our suc-pump output is connected to it, it empties a lot of water there which turns to ice in the winter. Thanks!

Confirmations Folder,,"So! A client has confirmed there appointment.

What do we do?

Objective: send them a confirmation email, and have all platforms uniform codes

Use the email received as a reference and pull up client in the Google Keep Database, you will use this database to record any essential information needed to know for scheduling, customer care, or the job.

the confirmation codes (which you will document in the Client's google keep note) include:

COE - confirmed over email
COT - confirmed over text
COP - confirmed over phone
CONF - confirmed
TCS - text confirmation sent
CES - confirmation email sent

we have a confirmation email template:

>scheduling folder in the bookmarks bar
>ONE NOTE Scheduling Department Notebook
>HotKeys Tab
>Copy whole Template


Methodology:

1. review contents of email
2. pull up Client's google keep note
3. document that we have receied confirmation by email: COE
4. record the date they are confirming for
5. ensure that it matches on our GCAL platform: PKRR CALENDAR (if it doesn't ask Scheduler)
6. Update the codes on the GCAL calender: PKRR
7. Once updated ""duplicate"" the PKRR entry and transfer to Master Cal
8. Color the PKRR entry its original color calendar which is the last on the list (blue)
9. Upon completion record in GKeep Client note: ""updated codes""
10. pull up the confirmation email template, copy
11. open draft new email in the residential@parkerswindowcleaning.com
12. paste the template in the body
13. cut and paste the ""subject line"" in the subject line, and remove ""Subject:""
14. Make the necessary edits in the email body: including Client Name, Date and arrival time (follow the template there), insert Passion's signature to close off the email
15. . refer to GKeep for the client's email and copy and paste to email draft
16. send and record confirmation email sent by inputting CES into the google keep note

Familiarize yourself with this process, the more familiar you are with it the easier this task will be!

Thank you for your hard work.

EMAIL SENT THROUGH QB FOR REFERANCE:

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting us!

I am looking into your date request of November 8th.

Please see your estimate for this year's services and confirm, then we can proceed with booking you in.

Please also send us your phone number for easier contact and our records, we seem to have overlooked it when restructuring company systems.

Please let us know if we will be dealing with anything out of the ordinary with the cleaning. These may include but are not limited to:

- long term debris removal
- any type of gutter guards on the eaves troughs

Failure to mention full details involved in the cleaning may result in additional charges.

Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this estimate and any additional services.

The cleaner was prompt, polite, thorough and well organized. I'm extremely disappointed that I am being asked to pay for his parking ticket. Although happy with the work, I will not be using your company in the future.

returned the $50

apparently the report was that the client initially insisted to pay for it.

The length of the front gutter is approximately 12'.

I would like it fastened to the house, cleaned, and a gutter guard added.

When the tech is on their ladder, I would welcome them to look at the gutter along the side of the house, to check if repairs are needed and to see if the gutter (that should be on there) is in good working order.

Hi Emelia,
Thank you for providing this estimate. We would like to proceed with the services but will need to wait as a robin has a nest against the kitchen window below the eaves and we want her to remain uninterrupted.

Hello Monika,

Thank you for your confirmation and request.

Unfortunately, the window of arrival is to accommodate for any jobs scheduled before the appointment, as well as travel time.

However, I've made a note for the technician to call 30 mins before arrival and currently you are our second job for that day so it's likely that we will arrive around midday.

Please let us know if there are any other concerns or questions.

I will be sure to send the confirmation email shortly.

DEDUCTED PRICING REVISION FROM PARKER'S WINDOW CLEANING

To: Pat

I hope all is well.

We were assessing our old records on our Friday Harbor clients and found a discrepancy in this year's pricing that does not honor our prior arrangement. This is in reference to the exterior railings generally having been part of the exterior window cleaning price (separate from any post construction costs). I have removed the separate charge from this invoice and have adjusted the exterior window cleaning price and notes accordingly.

We have updated our records and sent you a revised sales receipt/invoice (no additional payment needed).

Please let us know if you have any questions, comments or concerns.

We want to remedy this asap and return the credit to you.

We can either e-transfer the difference back to you or credit you on your next cleaning.

The total credit is $69.16.

Please let us know which one you prefer.

We sincerely apologize for this matter and any inconvenience.

We are eager to set things straight.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hello Pat,

This is Passion from Parker’s Window Cleaning.

I successfully issued a refund of $69.16 to the card you provided.

I also spoke with head office and checked our records.

Firstly, thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate it.

Our crew was scheduled for a regular cleaning, but upon performing the service they noticed the heavy post construction, which is common in Friday Harbor. This does require a more in depth service.

We understand that you’ve already paid for a regular cleaning and for that reason would like to offer to schedule a post construction clean at a discounted rate.

Our original rate is $75/hour, but I was able to arrange a rate of $55/hour.

Please let us know if you would like to book this cleaning and I will set that up for you. We’d love to get your windows shining as per our standards.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Richard Demsyn-Jones,,"BOOKING NOTES: (photos are on bizconnect). done within two weeks.
My gutters overflow in one spot during the most extreme rains, twice this year. I want to try expanding the downspout hole that's nearby, because during those heavy rains some water (from the floor above that) has enough speed to flow past it. I was thinking of buying something like this device from Amazon: https://www.amazon.ca/Extreme-Flo-Downspout-Outlet-Designed/dp/B09FKGNR5L. I think I need someone who can make two visits: one visit to check if my idea makes sense and confirm I can buy the product, and then a second visit to install it.

Hello Sarah,

Before sending your estimate we just need you to confirm a couple things.
It is a bit tricky to see where your property ends and the others begin. I also cannot properly view the back from satellite view.
Please send us pictures of the front, back, and sides of your home.
We can book you in tentatively for May 10th arriving between 8:00am-4:00pm. Please let us know if this works for you.
Once you confirm the estimate, we will be able to confirm a date.
I have added 416-797-7272 to your details.
We have this number on file 905-827-1297 as well, Please let us know if it is still relevant.

To: Sue

We were assessing our old records and found a discrepancy in this year's pricing that does not honor our prior arrangement. This is in reference to the exterior railings generally having been part of the exterior window cleaning price. I have removed the separate charge from this invoice and have adjusted the exterior window cleaning price and notes accordingly.

I also noticed that we missed specific applicable discounts and have incorporated it into the discount value.

We want to remedy this asap and return the credit to you.

We can either e-transfer the difference back to you or credit you on you next cleaning.

Please let us know which one you prefer.

We sincerely apologize for this matter and any inconvenience.

We are eager to set things straight.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,

SUPERSHINE JANITORIAL (PKRC) MONTHLY GROCERY STORES,,"Stores #10 #13-18, #20 #22-36
#310 needs to be done twice a month, EVENLY SPACED APART
24 GROCERY STORES
KRIS STATEMENTS FROM PARKER SCHEDULING CHAT
There’s one job in Kingston that’s done twice a month
During business hours, pretty much anytime
Exterior, technically yes on the interior. But we never do the whole thing. Each time you go you do about 25% of it, always make sure to do the doors. That way it stays fairly clean.
And if anyone asks whoever does the job how often the stores get done, the person should say that they don’t know, and they just got sent that day
If there’s high windows in the store, then they aren’t to be done
Basically anything you can reach with an 6-8 foot pole
no post construction, scraping or anything like that (no decals either) just a standard cleaning, and if there are objects in the way we skip the windows?
Pricing is $65 per store for the Kingston stores and $60 per store for all the other stores.
Basically, we need to count on being there for about 45 minutes
You’ll have to get a dollar store receipt book, right Supershine janitorial on the top and then in the description right Window Cleaning, you need to get a manager to sign it and stamp it. Every store has a store stamp.

NOTES: no post construction, scraping or anything like that (no decals either) just a standard cleaning, and if there are objects in the way we skip the windows, anything you can reach with an 6-8 foot pole, no high windows like slanted roofs. interior cleaning rule of thumb: we never do the whole thing. Each time you go you do about 25% of it, always make sure to do the doors. That way it stays fairly clean.

Use dollar store receipt book, right Supershine janitorial on the top and then in the description right Window Cleaning, you need to get a manager to sign it and stamp it. Every store has a store stamp.

if they are asked how often the windows are done, they should say that they don’t know and that the company sends lots of different crews. - Kris

Also, this store starts monthly with the other Supershine stuff October 1.
Pay it would be $75 a month. Same deal, Windows in and out.
Feel free to add to the list in October
A stamp is not required for FreshCo locations, but the sign off should be the same otherwise






07/25/24
General over view of metro jobs
Windows had taken good time with out being cleaned in and out
With two more consecutive cleanings insides can always be kept clean with exception of doors
Early notice of managers can save time for waiting them to sign and moving stuff especially flowers out side.
Don’t promise manager a specific time for their store to be cleaned (someone called a manager notifying them a cleaner willl be on site @11am ‘I arrived at 5:20)he had moved stuff around store hence wasn’t happy.
A water key or two full backets are needed with a second mop just in case

BOOKING NOTES:
(urgent bc client might go to different company if we do not provide a estimate fast) - Client would like estimate of eaves cleaning of both his property and his neighbors joint home property too. Client would like one estimate for both homes (with included discounts such as neighbor/referral discount). But he mentioned if they accept and services are to be performed then two invoices should be made (one for client and one for neighbor). He was adamant that both him and the neighbor get discounts/have the same price if that makes sense.

Amazing.

We are also using a new booking and payment system that will give you and us a $50.00 discount when accepted by the client.

It is called Quarter Master.

May we use this system with you?

We would send you the info today, and you can accept it at your earliest convenience.

Once accepted, $50.00 would be discounted from your immediate cleaning booking.
