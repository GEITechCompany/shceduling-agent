CONTRACTOR NOTES:,"DIRT LINES AND MARKS ON THE SIGN ARE ACTUALLY INSIDE OF THE LETTERS THAT MAKE UP THE SIGN. NOT SURE HOW THIS HAPPENED AT ALL. PICTURES IF THE SIGN CLEANED RHE LAST TIME CLEARLY SHOW NO PORRF OF WATER GOING INTO THE SIGN OR THEEE MARKS EVEN BEGINNING TO FORM, SO CURRENTLY UNSURE OF WHAT CAUSED THIS. SIGN CAN BE TAKEN APART TO HAVE MUDDY DIRT CLEANED ON THE INSIDE, LABOUR FOR THIS JOB WOULD BE AROUND 1 HOUR OR LESS, ASSUMING ALL LETTERS WILL COME APART WITH NO ISSUES. SECOND SIGN DOES NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE.",,,
