CREW NOTES:,"All windows had light post construction except ones that were marked for replacement, which we were asked to clean anyways but weren't expected to do a good job on",,,
,All inside railing glass and stair railing glass super tricky to clean,,,
,At the start we were forced to start with rain long glass and then upstairs only,,,
,The client had us begin with inside rain long glass and then all together in the inside upstairs. We had to work around painters for the first 4 hours which made it especially difficult to work. At the beginning we had a plan and the client kept changing it on us based on her needs,,,
,We had little choice except to do our walk arounds in pieces. One for upstairs 1 for downstairs and one for outside. The client didn't make it so we could do it normally,,,
