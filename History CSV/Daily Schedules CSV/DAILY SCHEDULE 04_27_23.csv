COMP STATUS:,COMPLETE,
HOURS:,5.5 Hours ,
CREW NOTES:,Windows on road side remain spotty after waterfed completed. This problem happens every year on the road side. I speculate that it's due to road dust being blown up onto the windows while drying. Extra rinsing doesn't help much. Chair drop is probably a better option here,
